# ElectionPollApp
In this Android Mobile App, I used the Google Civics API to get the data of the political leaders of all the states at USA.
With that I displayed the information about the leads holding different position in the state with respect to the location of the user or the searched and selected location by the user.


Please have a look at the screenshots folder for the running app look.
